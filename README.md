# hello-world
My first repository

Hi There,

Stacey is here. 
I have been a Sr. UX Designer for a dozen years, and that's a good enough number for now. ;) 
I have now decided to make my pet projects happen, so I want to learn how to develop android apps myself. 

Wish me luck.


P.S. and then I started another GitHub repository for everything a11y related.
